NKay, so this app I made for my school. Here is the thing though. In the app (if you install it) you will see their is a problem with clicking-
through the list. When one clicks systematically going lower and lower down the scale it is fine. 
However, if one decides to click the first button and then clicks the 3rd button then it will not work.
I do not know why. One has to go through them systematically for them to work. (Probably a problem with the xml when i was listing out the-
buttons. (see if you can fix the problem..or not. Try and learn from me hime.... or correct me).
